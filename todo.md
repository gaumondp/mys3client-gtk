# MyS3 Client - Future Feature Requests

This document tracks feature requests and ideas for future versions of the MyS3 Client.

## Planned Features

### Advanced Tabular Data Editor

*   **Description:** Implement a dedicated editor view for structured data files. Instead of opening them as plain text, this view would present them in a spreadsheet-like grid.
*   **Formats to Support:**
    *   CSV
    *   XLSX
    *   Apache Parquet
*   **Core Functionality:**
    *   Read and display data in a tabular grid.
    *   Allow basic editing of cell content.
    *   Save changes back to the original file format.
*   **Current Status:** **Not yet implemented.** All of the above file types will currently open in the standard text editor.
